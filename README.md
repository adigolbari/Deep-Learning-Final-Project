# Deep-Learning-Final-Project
This project enhances transformer-based language models, specifically BERT to improve story-ending comprehension by fine-tuning a pre-trained model.

## References
- This project is based on the original implementation from [OpenAI's fine-tune-transformer-lm](https://github.com/openai/finetune-transformer-lm).
